//! The interactive client: owns inventory, shared layout, pane connections
//! and the draw scheduler. One owner for all
//! UI/VT state; the loop awaits input, protocol notifications and
//! bounded actor results, and redraws only when dirty under the ~60 Hz
//! cap — there is no idle poll timer.
//!
//! M3a implements structure, layout/tab operations and bindings plus lock.
//! Custom commands, notifications and remaining actions belong to M4.
