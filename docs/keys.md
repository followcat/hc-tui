# Keys

hc-tui uses Herdr's key model: press a prefix, then an action key. The default prefix is `Ctrl+B`. If you have a Herdr
config (`~/.config/herdr/config.toml`), hc-tui uses its prefix and bindings.

Press `Ctrl+B ?` for the full list, which you can search. It always matches your config.

The defaults you'll use most:

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+B q` | Detach (`hc` keeps running) |
| `Ctrl+B w` | Navigate workspaces |
| `Ctrl+B b` | Show or hide the sidebar |
| `Ctrl+B ?` | Search the key bindings |
| `Ctrl+B s` | Settings |
| `Ctrl+B c` | New tab |
| `Ctrl+B v`, `Ctrl+B -` | Split right, split down |
| `Ctrl+B h/j/k/l` | Move focus |
| `Ctrl+B z` | Zoom the pane |
| `Ctrl+B r` | Resize mode |
| `Ctrl+B x` | Close the pane |
| `Ctrl+G` | Lock the keyboard, so every key goes to the program. Press again to unlock. |

`Ctrl+B Ctrl+B` sends a literal `Ctrl+B` to the program. Custom commands bound in your Herdr config work here too.

Settings changed with `Ctrl+B s` (theme, status indicators, sound, toast delivery) are saved to your Herdr config.
Nothing else in that file changes. [Runtime](runtime.md) covers the prefix, lock and navigation in more detail.

## Scrolling a pane

`PageUp` and `PageDown` page the focused pane's scrollback by one pane height when the program does
not use them itself: a shell or a line editor on the normal screen, like a prompt that takes pasted
text. A program on the alternate screen, one reporting the mouse, or a pager in application cursor
mode gets the keys instead, so `less`, `vim` and similar apps keep their own paging. Modified page
keys such as `Ctrl+PageUp` always reach the program, and any key the program does get jumps the view
back to the bottom. The mouse wheel scrolls the pane the same way.

Inside a floating terminal (`type = "popup"`), every key goes to the popup's program, so `PageUp` and
`PageDown` do not page the pane behind it.

## Copy mode

`Ctrl+B [` enters copy mode on the focused pane. The program gets none of these keys; the copy cursor
walks the visible screen and the scrollback above it, and `y` copies the selection through OSC 52.

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `h` `j` `k` `l` or arrows | Move the copy cursor |
| `w` `b` `e` | Next word start, previous word start, word end |
| `W` `B` `E` | Same, on whitespace-delimited big words |
| `{` `}` | Previous or next paragraph (blank line) |
| `0` `Home` | Line start |
| `^` `$` `End` | First non-blank cell, line end |
| `g` `G` | Top of history, bottom of the screen |
| `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | Half page up, half page down |
| `PageUp` `PageDown` | Full page up, full page down |
| `/`, `?` | Search forward or backward; `Enter` runs it, `Esc` cancels |
| `n` `N` | Repeat the search forward or backward |
| `v` or `Space` | Start a selection; `V` selects whole lines |
| `y` or `Enter` | Copy the selection and leave copy mode |
| `Esc` | Clear the selection or search; press again to leave |
| `q` | Leave copy mode |

Rebind the entry key with `keys.copy_mode` in your Herdr config, for example `copy_mode = "prefix+escape"`.

The prefix still arms inside copy mode (unless a search prompt is open): press it, then a normal
binding key, or `Esc` to cancel the armed prefix. Because the prefix key is claimed first, the
copy-mode `Ctrl+B`/`Ctrl+F` page keys only fire when you have bound a different prefix.

Entering copy mode drops any mouse selection in progress.

Inside a popup terminal there is no copy mode: drag with the mouse to select over the popup's visible
frame and the selection copies on release, through the same OSC 52 path as pane selection.

## Alt shortcuts

None of these are bound by default. Add the ones you want to `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`, then press `Ctrl+B Shift+R`
to reload it.

### Switch tabs and agents

```toml
[keys]
previous_tab = "alt+left"
next_tab = "alt+right"
previous_agent = "alt+up"
next_agent = "alt+down"
```

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Alt+Left`, `Alt+Right` | Previous or next tab in the current workspace. Wraps around. |
| `Alt+Up`, `Alt+Down` | Previous or next entry in the sidebar's agents list. Wraps around. |

![Switching tabs and agents with Alt and the arrow keys](images/alt-arrows.gif)

`Alt+Up` and `Alt+Down` follow the agents list, so one press can land in another pane, tab, workspace or machine.
Machines that are offline are skipped. Plain shells aren't in the list: a program counts as an agent only while it has
a status.

### Floating terminal

A `[[keys.command]]` entry binds a key to a command. With `type = "popup"`, the command runs in a floating terminal over
the current tab. This one opens your shell on `Alt+F`:

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "alt+f"
type = "popup"
command = "exec \"${SHELL:-sh}\""
description = "open floating terminal"
width = "80%"
height = "80%"
```

![A floating shell opened with Alt+F](images/alt-f.gif)

`width` and `height` take a percentage or a number of cells. While the popup is open, every key goes to it, including
`Esc`.

A popup that just runs an interactive shell — like the `Alt+F` example above — is a *persistent float* per tab: press the
key again to hide it, press it once more to bring it back. Leaving the tab hides it too, but the program keeps running
and coming back shows it again if it was open when you left. It starts in the project directory of the tab it belongs
to, and it ends only when its program exits or when you close that tab or workspace. Other popup commands stay
one-shot: they close and end when you leave the tab. Set `persistent = true` on a `[[keys.command]]` entry to give any
popup command the same per-tab behavior, or `persistent = false` to keep even a shell one-shot. While a float is
starting, its own chord is held back until the terminal is up.

While a persistent float is focused, the keys bound to `previous_tab`/`next_tab`/`previous_agent`/`next_agent` — the
`Alt+arrow` shortcuts above, if you set them — still switch tabs and agents: the float parks on its tab and keeps
running, exactly as if you had clicked away. Any `[[keys.command]]` popup chord also still works, so `Alt+F` toggles
the float instead of typing into it. The program loses exactly those chords — press, repeat and release; everything
else, `Esc` included, reaches it, and an action with no binding loses nothing.

The persistent float draws a dressed frame: the panes behind it dim, a one-cell drop shadow sits right and below, and
the corners are rounded. Its title carries the binding, the owning tab and the program, with the hide chord hinted on
the right — the hint drops when the frame is too narrow to show it clear of the title. The border is the theme accent
while the float is focused and turns muted while the keyboard is locked (`Ctrl+G`).

```text
╭ float alt+f — work — zsh          alt+f hide · esc sends to program ╮
│                                                                   │
│  ~/project                                                        │
│  $                                                                │
│                                                                   │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
 ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
```

One-shot popups keep the plain square frame.

## Pasting text and images

`Ctrl+Shift+V` pastes text. That is your terminal's own shortcut, and the program receives it as a bracketed paste,
unchanged. While a popup is open the paste goes to the popup's program, wrapped only when that program asked for
bracketed paste, just like a pane.

On a remote endpoint `Ctrl+V` pastes a clipboard image instead. hc-tui reads your local clipboard, uploads the image
to the program's machine with `terminal.put`, and the program receives the path of the uploaded file. This applies to
`hc-tui --remote`, to hc-tui running inside an SSH session, and to a focused terminal on another machine
(`machine/tN`). On a plain local endpoint `Ctrl+V` goes to the program unchanged. Local programs read the clipboard
themselves, and Vim needs it for block-visual.

The trigger is `keys.remote_image_paste` in `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`, default `"ctrl+v"`. Set it to `""` to
disable the key. Two other gestures do the same thing wherever it applies: dropping an image file on the window, and
an empty bracketed paste. An empty paste is what a terminal sends for `Ctrl+Shift+V` when the clipboard holds only an
image. PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP and BMP are recognized, up to the 8 MB `terminal.put` limit. On Linux the read needs
`wl-paste` under Wayland or `xclip` under X11.

A copied image file works too. A file manager puts `x-special/gnome-copied-files` or `text/uri-list` on the
clipboard, and some tools put one absolute image path in `text/plain`. hc-tui resolves the local file and uploads its
bytes, the same way as a drop.

A paste that cannot work never fails silently. When the clipboard holds no image and no readable image file, `Ctrl+V`
still reaches the program, and a notice says so. When nothing can read the clipboard at all (no display, no tool, or a
clipboard owner that stopped answering), the notice says why.
