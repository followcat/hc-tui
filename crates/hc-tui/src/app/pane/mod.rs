// Derived in part from herdr src/pane/terminal.rs (Apache-2.0).
//! One pane connection: attach lifecycle, role (input/observe/size holder),
//! VT state, credit, input backpressure and reattach policy — all owned
//! here so the app loop only sees `PaneEv` events and drawing state.
//!
//! Wire truths this encodes (see the attach docs in `hc-proto` and
//! `docs/runtime.md`):
//! - `observe` is fixed at attach time; a role change is a fresh attach.
//! - `resumed` marks recovery attaches so they don't stamp fresh
//!   ownership activity; a user-initiated switch is `resumed: false`.
//! - RESIZE-before-paint is only guaranteed when the reply confirms
//!   `resize_notifications`; otherwise the core grid comes from
//!   inventory sizes (a documented legacy path — cross-connection
//!   ordering is not guaranteed there, so a resize may apply after
//!   some bytes it precedes).
//! - There is no owner identity on the wire: a core-grid report that
//!   persistently disagrees with our requested size only *suggests*
//!   another client owns it — surfaced as such, never a tug-of-war.
//! - Input is never replayed across terminals or attach incarnations:
//!   keys/paste queue only for the attach generation they were typed
//!   under, and encode only under the fresh post-paint VT.
